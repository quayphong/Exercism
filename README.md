## Topics: Strings and Arrays

* Arrays: ordered lists of items often used for sequential lists
* Strings: sequences of character data.

### Required tasks

**Strings**

- [x] Read String Questions in Interviews.
  - Learn 5 common types of String questions
  - Optimizing the normal implementation to reduce the comlexity of method
- [x] Watch [Memoization and Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I) video
  - Instead of only using recursion, we should use memory technique (array, dictionary) to optimize the performance of algorithm
- [x] Watch [Anagram Problem Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwRGPPB4tw) video
  

**Arrays**

- [x] Read Sorting Algorithms
  - Quick sort
- [ ] Watch [Introduction to Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkkFqlG0Hds) video
  - Cannot watch
- [x] Watch [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) video
  - Step 1: Dividing an array to 2 sub arrays. 
  - Step 2: Sorting those 2 sub arrays then merge them into one array orderly by comparing 2 each element of 2 arrays to pick up the smaller value into the parent array firstly. 
  - Recuring step 1 and step 2 for each sub array until sub array has one element.

**Coding**

- [x] Set up `exercism` and complete at least 2 exercises using `exercism submit`.
